<h1><marquee>Happy Friendship Day Rayaan.</marquee></h1>
<p>Rayaan is my first and my BEST FRIEND. We play together and study together in the same class.We have been together for more than 8 year.
   But the only problem is that he stays very far away from me.If I have to go to his house
   it will take about 1 hour.Our friendship is like brothers and I wish that he stays my friend forever.
   One more interesting thing is that he brings pasta,maggi and noodles in his tiffin and he shares it with all his friends.
   I am not able to forget those days and waiting for the school to re-open so that we can again meet.
